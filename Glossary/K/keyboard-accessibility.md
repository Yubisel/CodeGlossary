# Keyboard Accessibility In Web Design

Keyboard accessibility in web design refers to creating websites and web applications that can be easily navigated and interacted with using only the keyboard, without requiring the use of a mouse or other pointing device. This is particularly important for users with disabilities who may have difficulty using a mouse, as well as for anyone who prefers keyboard navigation. It is a crucial aspect of creating a user-friendly web experience, making sure that everyone can effectively use and interact with your website, regardless of their physical abilities or preferences.

## Explaining like you're five

Keyboard Accessiblity in web design is like making sure that each and every one can use your website even without a pointing device like mouse. Just like we use our keyboard to type and play games some people use it to navigate around the website and as a developer it's our job to make sure that all the buttons and links on our website are navigable so that everyone can have fun and do things easily, even if they can't use a regular mouse.
